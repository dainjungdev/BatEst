# Definition and relations of each parameters in EHM

### Qn (Negative Electrode Capacity)
- `Qn = 3.3 * hr`

### nu (Negative/Positive Electrode Capacity Ratio)
- `nu = 1` : equal capacities for negative and positive electrodes

### miu (Cyclable Lithium/Positive Electrode Capacity Ratio)
- `miu = 1` : equal amounts of cyclable lithium and positive electrode capacity

### tau_ref (Diffusion Time Constant Reference)
- `tau_ref = 200` : reference value for the diffusion time constant

### b (Negative Electrode Surface/Particle Volume Ratio)
- `b = 0.3` : surface to volume ratio of the negative electrode

### Ip_ref (Reference Exchange Current in the Positive Electrode)
- `Ip_ref = 20` : a reference value for the exchange current in the positive electrode

### In_ref (Reference Exchange Current in the Negative Electrode)
- `In_ref = 2` : reference value for the exchange current in the negative electrode

### Rf (Film Resistance): 
- `Rf = 0.01` : resistance of the film in the battery

### CE (Coulombic Efficiency)
- `CE = 1` : efficiency of charge transfer within the battery

### Q (Effective Negative Electrode Capacity)
- `Q = Qn/CE` : effective capacity of the negative electrode
